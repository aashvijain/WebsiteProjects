    <h1>Facts and Statistics</h1>
    <div class = "learn">
    <p id = "explain">What is fast fashion? Fast fashion is the culture of buying cheaper clothes that are "trendy." This industry has only thrived since the emergence of social media as regular people want to copy the styles and appearances of celebrities. Fast fashion, to them, is a perfect solution because it's an easy way to impersonate celebrities without spending too much money. However, there are many terrible impacts of this kind of fashion. </p>
    <p id = "explain">First, it creates a culture of disposability. Since these clothes are so cheap, they aren't made of very high quality materials so they go bad easily. A second reason is because these clothes go out of style. Their entire purpose is for people to wear while they're still trending, but as everybody knows, trends pass very quickly. Since they were already so cheap to begin with, many people feel comfortable just throwing them away or even donating these clothes. However, what they don't realize is that whenever they throw away these clothes, they end up sitting in landfills and just polluting the enviornment. Even places like Goodwill end up throwing away a lot of clothes that just sit in landfills. This waste is a leading contributor in climate change and global warming, which affects the entire planet severly. </p>
    <p id = "explain">Another terrible effect of fast fashion is the effect that it has on local communities. When factories make garments, the toxic waste flows into nearby water streams, such as rivers, and pollutes the water. Toxic fumes are also released in the air and can be detrimental to citizens' respitory health. These citizens also consume the water with toxic waste inside of it, which provides them with a plethora of diseases that they suffer from. Animals, such as fish, also consume this water and end up dying because of it, showing how our reckless decisions affect not only humans but also animals.</p>
    <p id = "explain">Finally, the managers that run these factories ignore multiple human rights violations as they force workers, specifically women, to work in these inhumane conditions. These workers are uneducated, so they are unqualified for every other jobs, forcing them to work for these garment factories. For example, in Bangladesh, cracks in the buildings of various garment factories were reported and ignored, because it would take both time and money to fix them. Due to this, the building collapsed and thousands were killed, and even more were injured. This was not the only scenario where people died because their managers decided to ignore these poor working conditions. The factory workers suffer the most brutal impacts when we decide to support fast fashion.</p>
