  <h2 id = "heading1">The Problem</h2>
  <p >Fast fashion is the cause of over ⅓ of the world’s pollution. Due to the disposable nature of cheap clothes, millions of garments end up in landfills every year. The methods of manufacturing fast fashion are also very unethical. Toxic waste from factories gets into nearby water streams and contaminates the water. Fumes from these factors are also released into the air contributing to increasing global warming and rising temperatures. As if all that wasn’t bad enough, the methods for producing these garments is very unethical. Managers overwork and underpay their workers severely. Most of these workers are uneducated women who have no other option besides taking jobs like these to provide for their families. There have been various instances, such as the Rana Plaza incident in Bangladesh where these working conditions were reported but ignored and due to that, thousands of workers lost their lives. </p>
      <p id = "secondparagraph">This issue affects people all around the world. However, some countries specifically have to deal with the effects more than others. For example, China, Bangladesh, and Vietnam are some of these countries. Above are pictures from all three places of the terrible working conditions that employees have to survive in. We in America also don't feel the effects of enviornmental pollution as much. The toxic waste from the factories does not go into our drinking water like it does in these other countries. The fast fashion industry has ruined the lives of so many innocent people, which is why we should do our best to minimize these harms. </p>
