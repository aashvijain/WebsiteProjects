My entire life, I have been completely closed off to the effects of fast fashion and I didn't even know until researching for this project just how impactful our clothes are. Many people around me don't even know that even though these factories are located in countries such as Bangladesh and China, we can feel the effects all the way from California.</p>
    <p>When I started reading about the people in these countries and how they're suffering, I was surprised. Fast fashion hurts more people </p>

    <p class = "paragraph">Hi! My name is Aashvi and I am a junior who grew up in Silicon Valley. I have been programming since I was in 4th grade (around 7 years now). First I started coding with Python, but then I moved on to other languages such as HTML,CSS,Javascript, and Java. When I'm not in school or coding, I am probably watching Netflix. I'm pretty sure that I have almost finished the entire catalog. My favorite show though has to be Dynasty. It's the perfect combination of business, which I love, and drama, which I also love. I also really love going to the mall and shopping. This passion of mine is one reason I chose this cause to talk about: I personally buy a lot of clothes, and when I realized the negative impact that my clothes could have on this world, I wanted to learn more so that I could make better decisions and stop contributing to this mess.</p>
    <p class = "paragraph">When I started researching for this website, I was incredibly surprised. How can something like garments, that seem so harmless, ruin so many peoples lives? Not only do these manufacturing practices affect the lives of the workers creating the clothes, they also affect the lives of everybody living in the area, as well as people on the other side of the globe. The impact of this issue is much larger than most imagine, which is why I created this website to help inform and educate others so that they could also stop indulging in fast fashion and help put an end to this issue.</p>
    <p class = "paragraph">From what I've seen, the problem isn't that customers who buy from stores such as Shein and H&M are bad people, it's that they just don't know exactly how harmful these companies are. For example, before I was forced to read various articles and stories, I had no idea that thousands of people actually died specifically because of this cause and that it wasn't a rare occurance. These companies have done an excellent job in marketing their products to make these issues seem irrelevant, which makes it easier for consumers to ignore. That's why the best solution to this problem is to educate consumers on the impacts of fast fashion, which was my driving motivation behind creating this website instead of contributing to the Fashion Revolution in another way.</p>
